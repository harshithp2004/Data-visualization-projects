## World Happiness Score 2022
The main objective of this project was to understand the what factors affects the Happiness of a country in which parameter it can be judged.
## Univariate Analysis
1.What does the line plot of 'Happiness Score' for the top 50 countries by rank reveal about the variation in happiness scores among these countries, and are there any noticeable trends or patterns?

Conclusion:The line plot reveals variations in 'Happiness Score' among the top 50 ranked countries. Some exhibit stable scores, while others show fluctuations, indicating diverse happiness trends.

2.What does the histogram reveal about the frequency of different happiness score ranges?

Conclusion:The histogram displays the distribution of 'Happiness Score,' showing peaks in specific score ranges. This suggests that happiness scores tend to cluster around particular values, indicating potential patterns in global happiness.

3.How is the density of "Explained by: Freedom to make life choices" distributed across its range?

Conclusion:The density plot reveals the distribution of 'Explained by: Freedom to make life choices' in the dataset. It shows a peak, indicating a concentration of values, suggesting varying levels of freedom's influence on life choices across regions or countries.

4.Can you analyze the distribution of 'Whisker-high' and 'Whisker-low' values using the side-by-side boxplots?

Conclusion:The side-by-side boxplots illustrate the distribution of 'Whisker-high' and 'Whisker-low' values, revealing differences in their variability and central tendencies. 'Whisker-high' generally exhibits higher variability, while 'Whisker-low' tends to have lower variability among the data points in the dataset.

5.Which are bottom 20 countries in terms of GDP per capita and Happiness score?

Conclusion:The pie charts provide a visual representation of the bottom 20 countries in terms of GDP per capita and Happiness score, highlighting the proportion of each country within these categories. It's evident that these countries exhibit varying degrees of economic and happiness disparities.

## Bivariate Analysis
1.Does a higher GDP per capita correlate with a higher happiness score?

Conclusion:The scatterplot illustrates the relationship between 'GDP per Capita' and 'Happiness Score,' showing a general positive correlation where higher GDP per capita tends to be associated with higher happiness scores. However, there are exceptions, indicating that other factors also influence happiness.

2.Is there a correlation between the level of social support and happiness?

Conclusion:The scatter plot with the regression line highlights a positive correlation between 'Social Support' and 'Happiness Score,' suggesting that countries with higher social support tend to have higher happiness scores. However, there is some variability in happiness scores, indicating that other factors also play a role in overall happiness.

3.How does healthy life expectancy relate to happiness?

Conclusion:The joint plot with a kernel density estimate (KDE) reveals the relationship between 'Healthy Life Expectancy' and 'Happiness Score,' indicating that countries with higher healthy life expectancy tend to have higher happiness scores. The KDE contour plot provides a visual representation of the density of data points in this context.

4.Do countries with higher freedom scores tend to have higher happiness scores?

Conclusion:The box plot visually compares the 'Freedom to Make Life Choices' among the top 20 countries with their respective 'Happiness Score.' It indicates variations in freedom's impact on happiness, with some countries exhibiting higher median happiness scores despite differing levels of freedom.

5.Is there any relationship between Happiness score and Corruption

Conclusion:The dual subplot analysis contrasts the relationship between 'Happiness Score' and 'Perceptions of Corruption' for the top 20 and bottom 20 countries. The scatterplots indicate varying associations, while the KDE plots show the distribution of data points, revealing potential patterns in how corruption perceptions affect happiness across different countries.

## Multivariate Analysis:
1.How do multiple variables collectively affect Happiness Score?

Conclusion:The pairplot displays pairwise relationships among selected variables, emphasizing the diagonal KDE plots for individual distributions and scatterplots for variable combinations. It offers insights into the distributions and potential correlations between 'Happiness Score,' 'GDP per Capita,' and 'Social Support,' highlighting any patterns or associations in the data.

2.How do the distributions of selected factors compare?

Conclusion:The correlation heatmap visualizes the relationships among selected variables ('Happiness Score,' 'GDP per Capita,' and 'Social Support'). Strong positive correlations are evident, indicating that as 'GDP per Capita' and 'Social Support' increase, 'Happiness Score' tends to rise as well, showcasing key associations within the dataset.

3.Does the "Freedom to Make Life Choices" have a relationship with "Happiness Score," and is this relationship color-coded by the level of "Social Support"?

Conclusion:The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between 'Freedom to Make Life Choices' and 'Happiness Score,' with data points color-coded by 'Social Support.' It offers insights into how freedom and social support interact to influence happiness, with varying degrees of support shaping this relationship across data points."

4.How does the visual comparison of factor contributions (excluding Generosity) for the top 20 and bottom 20 ranked countries, as presented in the side-by-side stacked area plots, offer insights into the disparities and trends among these distinct groups of nations?

Conclusion: The stacked area plots, showcasing factor contributions (excluding Generosity) for the top 20 and bottom 20 ranked countries. This visual comparison aids in discerning variations in influential factors between these two groups, facilitating insightful analysis of the dataset.
